# KeyDisplay
A simple Qt5 application so i know what keys i have toggled on and off.
Currently shows CapsLock, NumLock, ScrollLock. All overlays are SVGs and
can be easily modified without rebuilding, simply modifiy the SVGs in the
deploy folder (not the main folder) for the application to use them.
