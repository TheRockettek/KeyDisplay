# KeyDisplay
A simple Qt5 application so i know what keys i have toggled on and off.
Currently shows CapsLock, NumLock, ScrollLock. All overlays are SVGs and
can be easily modified without rebuilding, simply modifiy the SVGs in the
deploy folder (not the main folder) for the application to use them.
(currently shown in top right corner)

## Plans
[] Proper configuration of the position
[] Ability to add more svgs to denounce different key interactions
[] Maybe add a UI to do that?
[] Stop overlay from appearing in taskbar
